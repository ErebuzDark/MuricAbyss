                        <h1>History of Music</h1>
                        <p>
                            Although definitions of music vary wildly throughout the world, every known culture partakes in it, 
                            and music is thus considered a cultural universal. The origins of music remain highly contentious; 
                            commentators often relate it to the origin of language, with much disagreement surrounding whether music arose before,
                            after or simultaneously with language. Many theories have been proposed by scholars from a wide range of disciplines, 
                            though none have achieved wide approval. Most cultures have their own mythical origins concerning the invention of 
                            music, generally rooted in their respective mythological, religious or philosophical beliefs.

                            The music of prehistoric cultures is first firmly dated to c. 40,000 BP of the Upper Paleolithic by evidence of 
                            bone flutes, though it remains unclear whether or not the actual origins lie in the earlier Middle Paleolithic 
                            period (300,000 to 50,000 BP). There is little known about prehistoric music, with traces mainly limited to some 
                            simple flutes and percussion instruments. However, such evidence indicates that music existed to some extent in 
                            prehistoric societies such as the Xia dynasty and the Indus Valley civilisation. Upon the development of writing,
                            the music of literate civilizations—ancient music—was present in the major Chinese, Egyptian, Greek, Indian, 
                            Persian, Mesopotamian, and Middle Eastern societies. It is difficult to make many generalizations about ancient
                            music as a whole, but from what is known it was often characterized by monophony and improvisation. In ancient 
                            song forms, the texts were closely aligned with music, and though the oldest extant musical notation survives 
                            from this period, many texts survive without their accompanying music, such as the Rigveda and the Shijing
                            Classic of Poetry. The eventual emergence of the Silk Road and increasing contact between cultures led to the
                            transmission and exchange of musical ideas, practices, and instruments. Such interaction led to the 
                            Tang dynasty's music being heavily influenced by Central Asian traditions, while the Tang dynasty's music, 
                            the Japanese gagaku and Korean court music each influenced each other.
