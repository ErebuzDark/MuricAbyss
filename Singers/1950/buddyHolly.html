                    Charles Hardin Holley, known as Buddy Holly, was an American singer and 
                    songwriter who was a central and pioneering figure of mid-1950s rock and roll.
                    He was born to a musical family in Lubbock, Texas during the Great Depression,
                    and learned to play guitar and sing alongside his siblings. His style was
                    influenced by gospel music, country music, and rhythm and blues acts, which he 
                    performed in Lubbock with his friends from high school. Unhappy with Bradley's 
                    musical style and control in the studio, Holly went to producer Norman Petty 
                    in Clovis, New Mexico, and recorded a demo of "That'll Be the Day", among other songs.
                    Petty became the band's manager and sent the demo to Brunswick Records, which released 
                    it as a single credited to "The Crickets", which became the name of Holly's band.
