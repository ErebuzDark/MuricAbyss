                    Michael Joseph Jackson was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. 
                    Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures 
                    of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, 
                    along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. 
                    Jackson influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and video performances, 
                    he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, 
                    as well as the robot. He is the most awarded individual music artist in history.The eighth 
                    child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his professional debut in 1964 with his older brothers 
                    Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). 
                    Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records. He became a solo star with his 
                    1979 album Off the Wall. His music videos, including those for "Beat It", "Billie Jean", and 
                    "Thriller" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming 
                    the medium into an artform and promotional tool. He helped propel the success of MTV and continued 
                    to innovate with videos for the albums Bad (1987),
