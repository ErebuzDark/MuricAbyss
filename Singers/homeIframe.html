        When it comes to 2021's most popular music artists, who do you think takes the cake as the most famous 
        singer in the world? While we all have our own idea of who the best singers of all time are, the most 
        famous takes a little more into account. Sure, many of these popular singers could also be considered 
        the best ever or the best of their time, but talent isn't the only factor in determining the most famous 
        singers in the world right now. In determining who's number one, you might also consider who often makes 
        the headlines in 2021, who releases the most chart-topping songs, or even who has the best image.
        <br>
        <br>
        With all of this in mind, singers like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and The Weeknd could all top the list 
        of popular singers out right now. However, these big names are just a few of the world's most famous current singers. 
        You also have Ed Sheeran, Justin Bieber, and top female vocalists Demi Lovato, Dua Lipa, and so many more. 
        From American and English celebrity vocalists, to the biggest international heavyweights it's up to you to 
        decide just which of these people are the most famous star singers today.
